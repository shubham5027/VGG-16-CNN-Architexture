<h1>VGG16 Model for Keras MNIST Dataset</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using the VGG16 architecture for the MNIST dataset using Keras. The VGG16 model is a deep neural network architecture that has proven effective for image classification tasks.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Python 3.x</li>
    <li>Keras</li>
    <li>NumPy</li>
    <li>Matplotlib (for visualization)</li>
    <li>TensorFlow or other backend supported by Keras</li>
</ul>


<h2>Model Architecture</h2>

<p>The VGG16 model is implemented in the <code>vgg16_mnist.py</code> script. It consists of three convolutional blocks followed by fully connected layers for classification.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The model is trained for 10 epochs on the MNIST dataset, and the training/validation accuracy and loss are printed during training. Feel free to modify the training parameters based on your requirements.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>This implementation is inspired by the original VGG16 architecture proposed by Simonyan and Zisserman in the paper "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition."</p>
